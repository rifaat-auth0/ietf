   This specification defines a mechanism for including multiple subjects in a JWT. 
   A primary subject in an enclosing JWT with its own claims, and a related secondary
   subject in a nested JWT with its own claims.

      <t>
   JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519" format="default"/> is a mechanism that is used to
   transfer claims between two parties across security domains.  Nested
   JWT is a JWT in which the payload is another JWT.  The current
   specification does not define a means by which the enclosing JWT
   could have its own Claims Set, only the enclosed JWT would have
   claims.
      </t>
      <t>
   There are a number of use cases where there is a need to represent multiple related subjects in one JWT; 
   a primary subject and a related secondary subject.
      </t>
      <t>
    This specification defines a mechanism for including multiple subjects in a JWT. 
   A primary subject in an enclosing JWT with its own claims, and a related secondary
   subject in a nested JWT with its own claims. 
      </t>

    <t>
    Such a mechanism allows for a proper auditing trail that allows the resource server to identify who 
    accessed what resource and on behalf of whom. In some cases, this allows the service consuming such 
    a token to present some of the information contained in the nested JWT to the end user in real-time.
    In adittion, in some cases, this allows the resource server to apply authorization policies based on who 
    requested the access to the resource and on behalf of whom is the request. 
    </t>

   The following are few use cases that might benefit from such a concept, that fall into two different categories:

          <name>Primary Subject with Secondary Authority Subject</name>
          <t>
   A primary subject with a related secondary subject that has authority over the primary subject, e.g. Child/Parent, Pet/Owner.
          </t>
          <t>
   The secondary user (e.g., parent) logs in to an application (e.g., pharmacy application), gets redirected 
   to the authorization server, authenticates, and asks for permission to access resources (e.g., medication) 
   for the primary subject (e.g., child). 
   The authorization server then issues a JWT with the primary subject in the enclosing JWT and the secondary 
   subject in the nested JWT.
          </t>

        <section anchor="multiple-primary-subjects" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Multiple Primary Subjects</name>
          <t>
   Two or more primary related subjects e.g. a married couple. The authorization server is setup to provide one of 
   the subjects with permissions to access the other related subject resources.
          </t>
          <t>  
   One user (e.g., wife) logs in to a application (e.g., pharmacy application), gets redirected to the authorization server, 
   authenticates, and asks for permission to access resources (e.g., medication) for the other primary subject (e.g., husband). 
   The authorization server then issues a JWT with the primary subject in the enclosing JWT and the other 
   primary subject in the nested JWT.

        <section anchor="delegation-of-authority" numbered="true" toc="default">

          <t>
   A primary subject delegates authority over a resource to a secondary subject who acts on behalf of the primary subject,

        <t>
   In the following cases, the JWTs are issued by different issuers.

          <name>STIR</name>
          <t>
   <xref target="RFC8225" format="default"/> defines a PASSporT, which is a JWT, that is used to verify
   the identity of a caller in an incoming call.</t>
          <t>
   The PASSporT Extension for Diverted Calls draft <xref target="STIR" format="default"/> uses a nested
   PASSporT to deliver the details of an incoming call that get
   redirected.  An authentication service acting for a retargeting
   entity generates new PASSporT and embeds the original PASSporT inside
   the new one.  When the new target receives the nested PASSporT it
   will be able to validate the enclosing PASSporT and use the details
   of the enclosed PASSporT to identify the original target.
          </t>
          <t>
   In this case, the original JWT is issued by the calling service, and the new enclosing 
   JWT is issued by the retargeting service.
          </t>
        </section>

  <section anchor="nsm" numbered="true" toc="default">
  <name>Network Service Mesh (NSM)</name>
  <t>
   Network Service Mesh [NSM] is a mechanism that maps the concept of a
   service mesh in Kubernetes to L2/L3 payloads.
  </t>
  <t>
   NSM GRPS messages may pass through multiple intermediaries, each of
   which may transform the message.  Each intermediary is expected to
   create its own JWT token, and include a claim that contains the JWT it
   received with the message it has transformed.
  </t>
  <t>
   In this case, the original JWT is issued by the entity sending the initial message, 
   and the new enclosing JWT is issued by the intermediate entity.

  <section anchor="same-subject" numbered="true" toc="default">

<section anchor="one-issuer-flow" numbered="true" toc="default">
    <name>One Issuer Flow</name>
    <t>
    In this case, one issuer is expected to issue multiple tokens to a user based on either some configuration 
    or some interaction with the involved subjects.
    </t>
    <t>
    In a typical flow in this case, the secondary subject initiates the interaction with the AS, authenticates, 
    and requests access to resources that belong to the primary subject. In some cases, e.g., child/parent, husband/wife, 
    the consent might be configured on the AS, and no interactive action is required by the primary subject. 
    In other cases, e.g., employee/admin, after the secondary subject has authenticated and requested access to the 
    resources of the secondary subject, an action might be required by the primary subject to approve the access request 
    by the secondary subject. In either case, the details of these interactions are out of scope of this document.
    </t>

    </section>


    <section anchor="multiple-issuers-flow" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Multiple Issuers Flow</name>
    <t>
    In this case, one issuer issues a token that is then used by one client to interact with a second issuer, 
    provide the first token to the second issuer, and request a new token that includes the first token as an 
    embedded token in the new token.
    </t>
    <t>
    In a typical flow in this case, one client requests a token from one issuer with some permissions. 
    The client then sends that token to a second issuer, which validates the token, and needs to 
    transform or add additional permissions to the first token, but it cannot change the first token. 
    The authorization server then issues a new token that either transforms the initial token or adds 
    more permissions to the new token to extend the permissions in the initial token, and embeds the 
    initial token into this new token.
    </t>

    </section>


    <section anchor="token-issuance" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Token Issuance Request</name>
      <t>
   When a client receives a token, and it needs to transform or/and enhance the permissions of the token, the client will send an token request to the AS, and include the received token to be embedded in the newly issued token that contains the transformed token details or permissions.

The Personal Assertion Token, PASSporT, is cryptographically signed to protect the integrity of the identity of the originator and to verify the assertion of the identity information at the destination.  The cryptographic signature is defined with the intention that it can confidently verify the originating persona even when the signature is sent to the destination party over an insecure channel.  PASSporT is particularly useful for many personal-communications applications over IP networks and other multi-hop interconnection scenarios where the originating and destination parties may not have a direct trusted relationship.</t>
