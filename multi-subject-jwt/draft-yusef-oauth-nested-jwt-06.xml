      <t>
   JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519" format="default"/> is a mechanism that is used to
   transfer claims between two parties across security domains.  Nested
   JWT is a JWT in which the payload is another JWT.  The current
   specification does not define a means by which the enclosing JWT
   could have its own Claims Set, only the enclosed JWT would have
   claims.
      </t>
      <t>
   There are a number of use cases where there is a need to represent multiple related subjects in one JWT; 
   a primary subject and a related secondary subject.
      </t>
      <t>
    This specification defines a mechanism for including multiple subjects in a JWT. 
   A primary subject in an enclosing JWT with its own claims, and a related secondary
   subject in a nested JWT with its own claims. 
      </t>

    <t>
    Such a mechanism allows for a proper auditing trail that allows the resource server to identify who 
    accessed what resource and on behalf of whom. In some cases, this allows the service consuming such 
    a token to present some of the information contained in the nested JWT to the end user in real-time.
    In adittion, in some cases, this allows the resource server to apply authorization policies based on who 
    requested the access to the resource and on behalf of whom is the request. 
    </t>

        <section anchor="prim-with-sec-authority" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Primary Subject with Secondary Authority Subject</name>
          <t>
   A primary subject with a related secondary subject that has authority over the primary subject, e.g. Child/Parent, Pet/Owner.
          </t>
          <t>
   The secondary user (e.g., parent) logs in to an application (e.g., pharmacy application), gets redirected 
   to the authorization server, authenticates, and asks for permission to access resources (e.g., medication) 
   for the primary subject (e.g., child). 
   The authorization server then issues a JWT with the primary subject in the enclosing JWT and the secondary 
   subject in the nested JWT.

          <t>
   Two or more primary related subjects e.g. a married couple. The authorization server is setup to provide one of 
   the subjects with permissions to access the other related subject resources.
          </t>
          <t>  
   One user (e.g., wife) logs in to a application (e.g., pharmacy application), gets redirected to the authorization server, 
   authenticates, and asks for permission to access resources (e.g., medication) for the other primary subject (e.g., husband). 
   The authorization server then issues a JWT with the primary subject in the enclosing JWT and the other 
   primary subject in the nested JWT.

        <section anchor="delegation-of-authority" numbered="true" toc="default">

   A primary subject delegates authority over a resource to a secondary subject who acts on behalf of the primary subject,

   <xref target="RFC8225" format="default"/> defines a PASSporT, which is a JWT, that is used to verify
   the identity of a caller in an incoming call.</t>
          <t>
   The PASSporT Extension for Diverted Calls draft <xref target="STIR" format="default"/> uses a nested
   PASSporT to deliver the details of an incoming call that get
   redirected.  An authentication service acting for a retargeting
   entity generates new PASSporT and embeds the original PASSporT inside
   the new one.  When the new target receives the nested PASSporT it
   will be able to validate the enclosing PASSporT and use the details
   of the enclosed PASSporT to identify the original target.
          </t>
          <t>
   In this case, the original JWT is issued by the calling service, and the new enclosing 
   JWT is issued by the retargeting service.

   Network Service Mesh [NSM] is a mechanism that maps the concept of a
   service mesh in Kubernetes to L2/L3 payloads.</t>
          <t>
   NSM GRPS messages may pass through multiple intermediaries, each of
   which may transform the message.  Each intermediary is expected to
   create its own JWT token, and include a claim that contains the JWT it
   received with the message it has transformed.</t>
          <t>
   In this case, the original JWT is issued by the entity sending the initial message, 
   and the new enclosing JWT is issued by the intermediate entity.

      <t>
   The existing security considerations apply to the use cases where the JWTs are issued by the same entity.
   Allowing more than one subject to access the same account might open the door for potential abuse.
   Care must be taken to ensure that when a secondary subject is added to an account that an adequate approval process is in place.
      </t>
      <t>
   In the multiple issuers use cases, the entity handling the incoming authorization request that contains a JWT MUST validate 
   the token and ensure that it is coming from a trusted entity, before attempting to embed that JWT into a new multi-subject JWT issued 
   by the AS.

              <t>This document defines a method for creating and validating a token that cryptographically verifies an originating identity or, more generally, a URI or telephone number representing the originator of personal communications.  The Personal Assertion Token, PASSporT, is cryptographically signed to protect the integrity of the identity of the originator and to verify the assertion of the identity information at the destination.  The cryptographic signature is defined with the intention that it can confidently verify the originating persona even when the signature is sent to the destination party over an insecure channel.  PASSporT is particularly useful for many personal-communications applications over IP networks and other multi-hop interconnection scenarios where the originating and destination parties may not have a direct trusted relationship.</t>
